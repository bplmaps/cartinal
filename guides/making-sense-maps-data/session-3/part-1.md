# Metadata: data about the data

## Basics of metadata

* To become data detectives, we have to be readers—and writers—of metadata.

Metadata is almost like the liner notes to an album (in this metaphor, the music itself would be the data set).

* **Metadata** provides information about data. Recording information about datasets is just as important as the dataset itself. Metadata can help answer questions such as:
    * Who collected the data?
    * What methods were used?
    * Why? For what purpose?
* This information is vital for considering how we should or should not use any given dataset. 

## Where to find metadata

* **If it exists,** metadata will typically be on the page where you downloaded the dataset or in a separate textfile that is downloaded with the dataset itself.
* Sometimes, metadata is embedded in a data file itself.
    * But there are many different formats that metadata can take, from simple descriptions to complicated computer-structured formats. Metadata is itself data!
* When in doubt, [ask a librarian](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial/).

## Making your own metadata

* If you are making your own dataset, it is your responsibility to create and share the metadata with others! 
* Metadata should give context to the dataset you created so that others may use it with the correct intentions. The form that metadata takes varies widely, but always tries to cover things like purpose of this data collection, information about the columns of your dataset, and when it was created. 
* The Map Center offers [guides](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/guides/readme-instructions.html) on how to get started capturing good metadata in a README for data preservation and reusability.
