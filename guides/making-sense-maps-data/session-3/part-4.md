# Missing data 

* Metadata is often missing—but data istelf is often missing, too! 
* Even within a given data set, a value like `0` might actually mean zero—or it might simply mean that the data was not recorded.
* Some data isn't just missing within a dataset; it's missing altogether!
* **Missing data** is a concept that describes phenomena that have not been recorded into datasets; we may not even realize that these phenomena exist! For one reason or another (or many reasons), these phenomena are rarely or never documented.
* **The lack of data about the phenomena does not mean they don't occur**
    * Centuries of societal norms and thought practice have built up into what is recorded and mapped and what is not. 
* Sometimes there are strategic explanations for missing data such as concerns for the privacy and safety of those involved in a situation.
* We hope this course empowers you to identify what isn't being mapped, identify *why*, and then figure out what you can do about it!

Artist Mimi Onuoha has compiled her thoughts on missing data which you can read [here](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). She writes the following:
> "Missing data sets" are my term for the blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated. My interest in them stems from the observation that within many spaces where large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live. Unsurprisingly, this lack of data typically correlates with issues affecting those who are most vulnerable in that context.

Essentially, data does not show us a complete picture of the world. There could be very real and pervasive phenomena in the world that we experience as humans that—because it's not recorded into datasets—does not get mapped. It's important to remember that just because the data doesn't exist to describe a phenomenon doesn't mean the phenomenon isn't real. Centuries of societal norms and thought practice have built up into what is mapped and what isn't. We hope this course empowers you to identify what isn't being mapped and what you can do about it! However, sometimes there are strategic reasons for missing data such as privacy and safety of those being counted.

Onuoha also outlines a few reasons why data are missing, including
> 1. Those who have the resources to collect data lack the incentive to (corollary: often those who have access to a dataset are the same ones who have the ability to remove, hide, or obscure it)
> 2. The data to be collected resist simple quantification (corollary: we prioritize collecting things that fit our modes of collection).
> 3. The act of collection involves more work than the benefit the presence of the data is perceived to give.
> 4. There are advantages to nonexistence.

Does this list make you think of any recurring themes we've discussed in this class? Can you think of an example of a missing dataset?
