# What is a map? What is data?

## How are maps and data different?

* You might find that the terms “maps” and “data” blend together in your head, or perhaps they don’t seem connected at all.
* You might wonder ...
    * Is a map data?
    * Does a map *show* data?
    * Is a map *made up of* data?
    * Are *all* maps related to data?
* A metaphor from language:
    * Data makes up the "words" which, in isolation, don't mean very much.
    * A mapmaker combines data components to communicate visually with a map.
    * Breaking down a map allows us to understand its components and learn to "speak" the language of mapmaking.

A good way to think about it is this: When someone is working on their written literacy skills, they usually practice both reading *and* writing to become a more skilled communicator. We believe visual means of communication (like maps) are exactly the same — in order to best "read" maps, you should also be able to understand a little about how they were made. Today, this almost always involves the use of geospatial data. You can think about data, with all of its formats, rules and structure, like the underlying grammar beneath maps.

## Data as observations about the world

* Data refers to **observations about the world that have been captured by humans and machines.**
* You might have a strong association between the word "data" and "numbers in a computer."
* Data is really a more general term about _information_.
    * Medieval European maps were made up of "data" that were gathered from sources of evidence like the passages of the Bible.
    * For example, what kinds of data would have been required by the mapmaker of this ["mappa mundi?"](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n5934)

**Consider this:** Can you think of a type of geographic data that you create and use in your everyday life? What observations of space and place do you make all the time?

* Imagine an ordinary web map that you might use to get to the nearest coffee shop.
    * It would include data about ...
        * Where coffee shops are located,
        * What those coffee shops are called and when they're open,
        * Where you are located,
        * How you're planning to get around (walk, bike, transit, drive),
        * How roads and paths are connected in space,
        * What the roads are named,
        * And more!

<hideable title = "A grammatical note on 'data'">

To most English-speakers, data sounds like a singular noun. It's common to say "data is a general term about information," or "data records phenomena." as we have done above. But some practitioners think of data as a plural; you'll hear people say "data are observations about the world," or "data record phenomena." There's no consensus about which is correct, even among data scientists! In this course, we use data as a singular noun.

What kinds of stereotypes of data are evident from the results? What is data, according to these search results?
