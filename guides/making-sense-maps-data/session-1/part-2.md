# Exercise: Draw Your Own Map

## What geographic information is already in your head?

<aside>

Check out these COVID-era [hand drawn maps](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-coronavirus-lockdown-neighborhood-maps/) of people's homes and neighborhoods! 

</aside>

* Pick a place that's important to you.
    * It could be where you live, your school, or another familiar location.
* Grab a piece of paper and take 5 minutes to draw this place.
* Add as much information as you can about this placeâ€”colors, explanations, labels and whatever else comes to mind!



## How would you tell a computer what you know?

* Now go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and find the same location you mapped.
* What is different about how you drew the place and how it's shown on the computer map?
    * Is anything missing from either map?
    * Which map seems more "accurate" to you?
* How do you think OpenStreetMap stores data associated with what appears on the screen?
