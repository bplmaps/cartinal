Welcome back to **Making Sense of Maps and Data**!

## In this session, we will

* dive deeper into different types of data
* learn about how the geometry of spatial data is connected to the shape of the real world ("projections")
* go over the concept of how to relate spatial data and attributes ("joining" data)
* review some common file types you might encounter when making a map
* have a closer look at the LMEC Public Data Portal and learn about metadata  

## From last time

In the [last session](../session-1), we...

* introduced the basics of maps and data
* discussed the differences between maps and the data that underly them
* discussed the conscious and unconscious biases engrained in the maps we view and create

## Key Terms

* join
* projection
* coordinates
* identifier
* Shapefile
* GeoJSON

## Goals of this session

At the end of this less, you'll be able to:

* Explain what is needed in order to bring data about space (geometry) together with data about what's happening in those spaces (attributes)
* Identify the most common types of file formats used in maps
* Understand the difference between data and metadata
