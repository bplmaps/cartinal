**So You Want to Make a Web Map** is a guide designed for adult learners getting started with web mapping. **Web mapping** is the process of delivering geospatial data through the internet, as opposed to via files on your own computer, in the form of interactive maps.

If you want to create a map where your audience can:

- Pan around and zoom in/out
- Click data layers on and off
- Adjust layer opacity
- Share using a stable link

Then a web map is probably right for you!

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your very own web map using the JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and the online development environment [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com).

It's okay if you don't know what those things mean just yet. That's what the tutorial is for! By the time you're done, you'll be able to create something like this:

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/synagogues-example?path=index.html&previewSize=100"
    title="synagogues-example on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; encrypted-media; xr-spatial-tracking; fullscreen"
    allowFullScreen
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

Since this guide does not cover the basics of geospatial data creation and manipulation, we recommended checking out our guide on [Making Sense of Maps and Data](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/making-sense-maps-data/) before or alongside this one.
