## What's web mapping?

**So You Want to Make a Web Map** is a guide designed for adult learners getting started with web mapping.

**Web mapping** is the process of delivering geospatial data through the internet, as opposed to via files on your own computer, in the form of interactive maps.

Similarly, a **web map** refers to maps that are [both *on* the web and *powered by* the web](http://132.72.155.230:3838/js/leaflet.html#what-is-web-map). That means web maps commonly "pull" geospatial data layers from other sources on the webâ€”without ever being downloaded to your computer!

In short, if you want to create a map where your audience can:

- Pan around and zoom in/out
- Interact with data layers
- Adjust layer opacity
- Share using a stable link

Then a web map is probably right for you! By the time you're done, you'll be able to create something like this:

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/synagogues-example?path=index.html&previewSize=100"
    title="synagogues-example on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; encrypted-media; xr-spatial-tracking; fullscreen"
    allowFullScreen
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

## What's in this guide?

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your very own web map using the JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and the online development environment [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com). You'll come away with a basic understanding of how to put programming languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to use for web mapping, as well as a high-level knowledge of how geospatial data is parsed by and transferred through modern web protocols.

It's okay if you don't know what those things mean just yet. We know that programming jargon can be very alienating, so this guide assumes zero prior knowledge with web development. 

Note that this guide does **not** cover the basics of geospatial data creation and manipulation. We recommended checking out our guide on [Making Sense of Maps and Data](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/making-sense-maps-data/) before or alongside this one.
