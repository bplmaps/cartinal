**So You Want to Make a Web Map** is a guide designed for anybody getting started with web mapping.

A **web map** refers to maps that are both *on* the web and *powered by* the web. Not only are web maps accessed online, but they commonly pull geospatial data layers from other sources on the internet.

Also see https://maptimeboston.github.io/web-maps-101/#0

If you want to create a map where your audience can:

- Pan around and zoom in/out
- Interact with data layers
- Adjust layer opacity
- Share using a stable link

Then a web map is probably right for you. By the time you're done, you'll be able to create something like this:

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/synagogues-example?path=index.html&previewSize=100"
    title="synagogues-example on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; encrypted-media; xr-spatial-tracking; fullscreen"
    allowFullScreen
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

## What's in this guide?

In this guide, you'll learn how to create your very own web map using the JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and the online development environment [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com). You'll also learn the basics of putting programming languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to use for web mapping, as well as a high-level knowledge of how geospatial data is parsed by and transferred through modern web protocols.

It's okay if you don't know what those things mean just yet. Because programming jargon can sometimes be alienating, this guide assumes zero prior knowledge with web development.

Note, however, that this guide does **not** cover the basics of geospatial data creation and manipulation. We recommended checking out our guide on [Making Sense of Maps and Data](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/making-sense-maps-data/) before or alongside this one.
