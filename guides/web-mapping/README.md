**So You Want to Make a Web Map** is a public instruction program designed for adult learners getting started working with geospatial data and digital mapmaking. This program is being initially offered as a synchronous session, with course material developed for on-your-own future learning.

Participants in Making Sense of Maps & Data will learn what kinds of information are needed to make a map on a computer, and how to find this kind of information on the internet. The course also aims to equip participants with a careful and critical attitude towards the social power of computer data. This course serves as a springboard to more advanced work creating GIS and computer maps, and also teaches data literacy skills that are essential for interpreting information on the maps that are all around us.
