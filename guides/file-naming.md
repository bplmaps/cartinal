# File Naming Conventions

## Background Information

There are tips to naming your files which can prevent a lot of headaches down the road. In some cases, problems can arise due to the way commercial software like ArcGIS manages data, but good **data hygiene** is important no matter what software you're using to make maps and conduct spatial analysis. A little mistake, like saving a shapefile as `final-dataset.shp`, is the first step on the path towards `final-FINALdataset2_USEME`â€”and that is *not* a path down which we want to go!

You can prevent these problems by always using best practices for file nomenclature to ensure data is preserved, compatible and usable in the long-run.
