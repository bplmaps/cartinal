# Georeferenced Map Collections

The Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC) is home to nearly a thousand georeferenced maps and atlases, all of which are free for public use.

## Accessing maps previously georeferenced in Map Warper

:::tip LMEC Map Warper
The Map Warper integration which was set up in our Digital Collections site is unfortunately no longer being supported. The source Map Warper software this was based on, and the crowdsourced add-on to the original software requires many outdated dependencies that make the tool's upkeep extremely difficult and less-than-operational.
:::
You can access maps which were georeferenced using our Collections portal instance of Map Warper prior to the software's expiration by doing the following:

1. Visit <a target = "_blank" href ='https://www.collections.leventhalmap.org'>collections.leventhalmap.org</a>
2. Return all map results by clicking the blue search button on the home page
![Search Collections](./media/search-collections.png)
3. Filter by only the maps that have been georeferenced. Do this by scrolling down the filters on the left hand side of the page, and selecting `Georeferenced → Yes `
4. Pick a map from the resulting list
5. On the page showing the map, scroll below the map image to the `Downloads` section
6. To download a GeoTIFF for use with GIS software, select `Downloads → GeoTIFF` 
7. To find a web layer link that will be compatible in QGIS, ArcGIS Online, Leaflet, and so on, select `Downloads → See More Downloads (Warped PNG, KML, WMS Tile URL) → Tiles (Google/OSM Scheme)` 

## Accessing maps georeferenced in Allmaps
[Allmaps](https://allmaps.org) is a platform for web georeferencing that relies on the IIIF protocol and WebGL to warp maps in a web browser. While Allmaps is still under development, you will eventually be able to access any maps previously georeferenced in Map Warper there as well. You'll also be able to add new maps to those collections. Stay tuned for more info in fall 2022!
