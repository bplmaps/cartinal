# Adding a dataset to the LMEC portal 


## Gathering information about the dataset

It's always easier to proactively collect information about how the dataset was created, cleaned, processed, analyzed etc at the beginning of the project, rather than trying to retroactively go back and piece it all together.

If you are the one doing the data processing, jot down your cleaning steps, links to where the data came from, etc that you can use later when writing the metadata record.

If you are working with an external data partner, talk to them ahead of time, if possible, and encourage them to document their processes *during* their workflow. The [How to Create a README Guide](../guides/readme-instructions.html) is a public-facing document written to send to data partners for this purpose. 

## Storing the data

If you plan to actually store an archive or snapshot of the data (rather than simply pointing out to data hosted elsewhere), the place to store data is in the LMEC Wasabi S3 Cloud Storage.
