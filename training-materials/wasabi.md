# Wasabi

## What is Wasabi?

[Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/) is S3 Cloud storage the LMEC uses to store digital assets.

Some reasons we use Wasabi:
1. It is cost-efficient 
2. BPL also uses it for digital assets
3. The company is Boston-based

## How does LMEC use Wasabi?

There is one main account, registered under the frontdesk@leventhalmap.org email. The manager of this service (previously Belle), creates sub-users, which each have their own username/passwords/access keys to log in. The main account login is in the LMEC passwords.

If you are the new manager of this service, you can use Wasabi's online documentation, or call customer service if you have any questions about the nuances of how Wasabi works. Their customer service is prompt and helpful. 

## What does LMEC store in Wasabi? 

Top-level folders in Wasabi are called `buckets`.
